# renameMP3
I have a bunch of folders with arbitrary names from an old Ipod. 
This script gets the artist metadata, creates a folder for each unique artist, and moves the files into that folder.
It also renames the MP3s at the end, but that part is commented out.

Requires:
mutagen
os
glob
pathvalidate
